# Embedded program annotations supported by CompCert:
- CompCert C provides a mechanism to annotate C source code with information (that is fed to AbsInt for various kind of analysis). 
- With CompCert's annotation mechanism it is possible to reliably annotate on C source code level and reason about C variables instead of using code addresses or processor registers.
