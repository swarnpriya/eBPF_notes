# Introduction 

- eBPF is a technology used with origins in Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in privileged contexts such as operating system kernel.
- It can be used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without requiring to change the kernel source code.
- It allows the sandboxed programs to run within the operating system. The application developers can run eBPF programs to add extra functionality to the operating system at runtime.
  The operating system then provides the security and efficiency as if natively compiled with Just-In-Time compiler and verification engines. 
- eBPF programs can be written by developers that can be dynamically loaded at runtime to change the functionality of the kernel.
